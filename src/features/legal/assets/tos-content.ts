By accessing or using the Parcener web application ("the Service"), you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.

**Parcener is an independently developed open-source project provided by Colin Gorski.** Throughout these terms, "we," "us," and "our" refer to the operator of the Parcener project.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

Parcener is a collaborative expense-splitting tool that utilizes Artificial Intelligence to parse receipts. The Service includes:

- Receipt image upload and AI-powered processing.
- Creation of shareable "Rooms" for collaboration.
- Real-time item claiming and split calculation.
- Display of payment identifiers (e.g., Venmo usernames) to facilitate settlement.

## 3. Open Source & Licensing

**Source Code:**
The source code for Parcener is available publicly. Your use of the _source code_ (e.g., forking the repository to run your own instance) is governed by the open-source license included in the repository (MIT License).

**Hosted Service:**
These Terms of Service apply specifically to your use of the **hosted application** at **parcener.app**. We reserve the right to update, modify, or discontinue the hosted Service at any time.

## 4. Account & Access

### Authentication

- You must sign in using a valid Google Account.
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Google credentials.

### Guest Users

- Users may access specific Rooms via a shared link without creating an account ("Guest Users").
- Guest functionality is limited.
- Guest sessions rely on browser cookies. If you clear your cookies or switch devices, you may lose access to your selections in that Room.

### Age Requirement

- You must be at least 13 years old to use Parcener.
- If you are under 18, you represent that you have your parent or guardian's permission to use the Service.

## 5. Acceptable Use & Fair Usage

The Service utilizes paid third-party APIs (such as Google Gemini) to function. To ensure the Service remains sustainable, you agree to **Fair Usage**.

**You agree NOT to:**

- Use automated systems (scripts, bots, spiders) to access the Service or upload receipts.
- Upload invalid images or content unrelated to expense receipts.
- Reverse engineer the API or attempt to bypass rate limits.
- Use the Service for any illegal purpose or to harass other users.

**Rate Limiting:**
We reserve the right to limit the number of receipts you may upload or process in a given timeframe to prevent abuse and manage costs.

## 6. User-Generated Content

### Ownership

- You retain full ownership of the receipts and data you upload.

### Limited License

By uploading content, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, store, copy, and process that content **solely for the following specific purposes**:

1.  **Collaboration:** Displaying the content to other participants within the specific "Room" you uploaded it to.
2.  **Processing:** Transmitting the image to our AI provider (Google Gemini) for text extraction.
3.  **Maintenance:** Internal debugging and error tracking to fix bugs or improve application stability.

**We will NOT publicly display, sell, or distribute your receipt images outside of the specific Room context.**

### AI Accuracy Disclaimer

- **Parcener uses Artificial Intelligence (Google Gemini) to extract text.**
- **AI IS NOT PERFECT.** You acknowledge that extracted data (prices, item names, totals) may contain errors.
- **You are responsible for verifying all data.** You should check the math and splits before making any real-world financial settlements.

## 7. Data Retention & Inactivity

- **Active Rooms:** Data is generally retained while a Room is active.
- **Inactivity Deletion:** To manage storage costs and user privacy, we reserve the right to **permanently delete Rooms (and all associated receipt images)** that have been inactive for **1 year** or more.
- **User Deletion:** You may request account deletion as outlined in our Privacy Policy.

## 8. Financial Disclaimer

- **We are NOT a Bank:** Parcener is a calculation tool, not a financial institution or payment processor.
- **Venmo Integration:** We may allow you to save your Venmo username to create deep links to the Venmo app. We do not process these transactions.
- **Disputes:** Any financial disputes (e.g., "You didn't pay me back") are solely between you and the other participants. Parcener provides the calculation, but the settlement is your responsibility.
